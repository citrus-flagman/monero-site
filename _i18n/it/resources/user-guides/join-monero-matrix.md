The monero community primarily communicates via IRC channels. We utilize these channels using the Matrix network. An open source network for secure, decentralized communication.

In order to access the Matrix protocol you will need to use a Matrix client. The client we recommend is Element. Element is a free, open-source program that can be accessed via web, desktop, and mobile.

### Web/Desktop Setup

Go to [element.io](https://element.io/get-started#download) to download the latest version of the Element app on your computer. Alternatively you can use the Element [web app](https://app.element.io). Once you have accessed the client click "Create Account"

While matrix is a federated protocol and you could use any host server for your account (including the default matrix.org server). We reccomend changing your server to the one hosted by the monero core team to support decentralization. If you do choose this option remember to set your custom server when logging in on a new device.

Click "Edit" to modify your account host server
